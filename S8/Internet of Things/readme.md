## Module 1
### what is IoT?
- IoT is a technology transition in which devices will allow us to sense and control the physical world by making objects smarter and connecting them through an intelligent network
### Genesis of IoT
- IoT started between 2008 and 2009
- There are four phases of evolution of internet
	- Connectivity - connected people using email and web services, getting a basic connection was also very hard
	- Networked Economy - e-commerce and digitally connected supply chain - using the connectivity was used for efficiency and profit, suppliers, vendors and consumers became more directly connected
	- Immersive Experiences - person to person interactions have become digitized - emergency of social media , collaboration and widespread mobility on a variety of devices
	- Internet of things - machines and objects connect with other machines and objects along with humans, experience huge increase in data and knowledge and automation
### IoT and Digitization
- IoT focuses on connecting devices to a network like the internet
- digitization focuses on the data generated by the connected objects and the business insights that result
- digitization brings together things, data and business process to make networked connections more relevant and valuable
### IoT impact
#### Connected Roadways
- Connected Roadways is the term associated with both the driver and driverless cars fully integrated with the surrounding transportation infrastructure
- new sensors and communication technologies are being developed to allow vehicles to talk to other vehicle, traffic signals, school zones, and other elements of the transportation infrastructure
- current challenges being addressed
	- safety - allow drivers to anticipate crashes and reduce the no of lives lost
	- mobility - make informed decisions and reduce traffic delays
	- Environment - give real-time info to people so that they can make "green" transportation choices
- benefits:
	- reduced traffic jams and urban congestion
	- decreased casualties and fatalities
	- increased response time for emergency vehicles
	- reduced vehicle emissions
- Eg:
	- IMA: Intersection Movement Assist - warn drives at intersection when there is a chance for accidents
	- automated vehicle tracking
	- cargo management
	- road weather communication
- The data generated by sensors can be used by third parties to integrate new features and manufacturers can also use it to improve their products
#### Connected Factory
- There are four industrial revolutions:
	1. Mechanical Assistance: application of steam and water to mechanical production
	2. Mass production: introduction of electricity and mass production
	3. Electronics and control: computers and electronics where introduced 
	4. IoT integration: a model where machines are intelligent and communicate with one another, inserting intelligence into factories
#### Smart Connected Buildings
- complex intersection of structural, mechanical, electrical and IT components
- in normal buildings, each system is managed as separate system that have little to no interaction with each other.
- smart building make them easier and cheaper to manage
- building automation system (BAS) has been developed to provide a single management system for HVAC, lighting, fire alarm, and detection system, as well as access control.
- all these different system need to converge at the network layer an support a common server layer that allow application integration. Eg: BACnet
- Digital ceiling: every light is connected directly to network which provide control and power, the network will also include sensors such as temperature and occupancy
#### Smart Creatures:
- sensors can be placed on animals and insects
- Eg: connected cow - Dutch company - sensor that can be placed inside a cow's ear, monitor health, location, transmit wirelessly for analysis by the farmer
- cockroaches can be equipped with a backpack on its back with sensor that can steer the cockroach and help finding trapper people in hard to access places
### Convergence of IT an OT
- IT supports connections to the internet along with the related data and technology systems and is focused on secure flow of data across an organization
- OT(Operational Technology) monitors and controls devices and processes on physical operational systems.
- IT is responsible for information systems of a business such as email, file and print services, databases etc
- OT is responsible for the devices and processes acting on industrial equipment such as factory machines, meters, actuators, SCADA etc
- If OT fails it can affect production, but if IT fails then there is less chance that it may affect production

- The overall benefit of IT and OT working together is a more efficient and profitable business due to reduced downtime, lower costs through economy of scale, reduced inventory, and improved delivery times.
### IoT Challenges:
- Scale - the network must be able to support large number of devices
- Security - as more devices are connected the security also becomes an issue, if a device on a network is compromised then it can be used as a launchpad for attacking other devices
- Privacy - as more data is collected privacy is very important, who own the data and to whom the data is to be shared
- Bid data and data analytics - large amount of data need to be processed and managed
- Interoperability - there are devices using various protocols and architectures with IoT
### IoT network architecture and Design
